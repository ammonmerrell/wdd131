            <h2>Detailed breakdown</h2>
            <p>(B)Rome: Rome is good at generating culture and having a millitary. The AI players may not like you and that can sometimes be out of your control, so it can be good to have a civ skilled at creating an army to defend yourself.</p>
            <p>(B)Norman: The normans are a defensive civ with the most unique civics in the game at five. They can also be good at attacking over water in the highly contested distant lands.</p>
            <p>(B)Mexico: Mexico may be the most versitile civ in the game. They can have a strong millitary, happines yeild, and science and culture yeild, they can do it all. All you need to do is slot your unique traditions in to unlock the potential of Mexico.</p>
