                <h2>Build around the terrain</h2>
                <p>You get bonuses for placing certain buildings next to spacific things. for example, placing culture and happines buildings next to mountians, natural wonders(These start on the map, like the Grand Canyon.) and wonders(Sometimes called "world wonders" these are different the natural wonders, and you need to build these.) yield extra culture and happines respectivly. Science, production, and millitary buildings grant their respective yeild when placed next to resourses(like horses) and wonders. Food and gold buildings are more effective when next to coast, navigable river, and wonders. Try to build next to these feature to make the most out of the buildings.</p>

                <h2>Construct Wonders</h2>
                <p>Wonders are powerful buildings that can give you massive bonuses. They are also high risk because only one can be built in a game. If multiple players are building the same wonder, one who completes it first keeps it and the others lose it and are granted a portion of production. Wonders also grant bonuses to all buildings exept warehouse buildings so they are so versitile for city planning. Each civ has one associated wonder that they can build faster then everyone else, and they can also unlock it through their unique civics tree.</p>

                <h2>General Stratagies</h2>
                <p>(B)Focus on the capital. The capital has the strongest city in the game. You can send out settlers to build towns which give the capital food when they are specialised at 7 population, as well as convert prodution to gold. Have multiple victory paths. Working on multiple victories allows you to be more flexible at the end when you are more likly to have different victory conditions.</p>
